# ChemCode
Matt Fraser and Scott Hersey worked together in April 2002 to write a fortran77 program that models the atmospheric chemistry of a region for which data has been collected.

In February 2016, Scott Hersey translated the original Fortran code into MATLAB so that his Chemistry in Context class at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering could use it for a project on atmospheric chemistry.

In March 2016, two of Scott's chemistry students, Celina Bekins and Cecilia Diehl, started work on a Software Design project which would visualize atmospheric chemistry data. That project is in progress. Celina is working on translating Scott's MATLAB code into Python. She and Cecilia are working together to write a pygame script for the visualization. The end goal is to, using data points collected from the smog model, create an interactive visualization of the atmospheric chemistry of different regions around the world.

All of the code mentioned here is present in this repository.
